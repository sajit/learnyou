Parametricity: When we can "follow the type" of a function to derive the only possible implementation, we say that the definition is `given by parametricity`

Partial functions: A partial function, is a function that is not defined for some of the inputs.There are different
approach to handle partial functions, but in functional programming typical only total functions are used.

Total functions are defined for all inputs.Ie every value of the input type maps to a value of the output type.
